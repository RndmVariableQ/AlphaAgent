potential_direction_transformation: |-
  It's the first round, the user provided a potential direction: "{{ potential_direction }}". Referring to it, you need to transform it into a hypothesis in formal language that is clear and actionable for factor generation. Consider the following aspects while formulating the hypothesis:
  1. **Clarity**: Ensure the hypothesis is specific and unambiguous.
  2. **Actionability**: The hypothesis should suggest a clear path for experimentation or investigation.
  3. **Relevance**: Ensure the hypothesis is directly related to the potential direction provided by the user.

model_hypothesis_specification: |-
  Additional Specifications:
    
    Hypotheses should grow and evolve based on the previous hypothesis. If there is no previous hypothesis, start with something simple. Gradually Build Up Upon previous hypothesis & feedbacks. In each round, hypothesis is different. Pay attention to your previous hypothesis.

    Ensure that the hypothesis focuses on the architecture of a PyTorch model. Each hypothesis should address specific architectural choices such as the type of layers, activation functions, regularization techniques, and the overall structure of the model. Avoid hypotheses related to input features or optimization processes.

  Remember: if there is no hypothesis, start with something simple like MLP.

  Usually, a larger model works better than a smaller one. 

  Logic for generating a new hypothesis: If the previous hypothesis works, try to inherit from it and grow deeper. If the previous hypotheis doesn't work, try to make changes in the current level.

  Sample hypothesis evolution loop: (This is the entire loop, see what stage you are at. We want hypothesis to continue growing.) Levels include **Model Type**, **Layer Configuration**, **Activation Functions**, **Regularization Techniques**

    1st Round Hypothesis: The model should be a CNN. 

    2nd Round Hypothesis (If first round worked: CNN is the model type level, which means that we should extend to the next level, like layer configuration): The model should be a CNN. The CNN should have 5 convolutional layers. (Reasoning: As CNN worked, we now specify the layers specification to grow the hypothesis deeper.)

    3rd Round Hypothesis (If second round didn't work): The model should be a CNN. The CNN should have 3 convolutional layers. (Reasoning: As 5-layer structure didn't work in the 2nd round hypothesis, try something else within the layer configuration level.)

    4th Round Hypothesis (If third round worked): The model should be a CNN. The CNN should have 3 convolutional layers. Use Leaky ReLU activation for all layers. (As last round worked, now proceed to the next level: activation functions)
    
    5th Round Hypothesis (If fourth round worked): The model should be a CNN. The CNN should have 3 convolutional layers. Use Leaky ReLU activation for all layers. Use dropout regularization with a rate of 0.5. (Similar Reasoning & Continuing to Grow to the dropout setup)

    6th Round Hypothesis (If fourth round didn't work):  The model should be a CNN. The CNN should have 5 convolutional layers. Use Leaky ReLU activation for all layers. Use dropout regularization with a rate of 0.3. (Reasoning: As regularisation rate of 0.5 didn't work, we only change a new regularisation and keep the other elements that worked. This means making changes in the current level.)    

factor_hypothesis_specification: |-
  1. **Justification of Factor:**
      - Explain the market behaviors indicated by this factor.
      - Omit unnecessary or redundant details.

  2. **Key Considerations in Factor Construction:**
      - **Data Preprocessing and Standardization:**
          - Avoid using raw prices and volumes directly due to scale differences
          - Use relative changes or standardized data (e.g., RANK(), ZSCORE())
          - Convert prices to returns (DELTA($close, 1)/$close) instead of price levels
          - Transform volume into relative changes (DELTA($volume, 1)/$volume)

      - **Time Series Processing:**
          - Avoid forward-looking bias
          - Use DELAY() to ensure only historical data is used
          - Consider appropriate sample periods for indicators requiring historical data
          - Choose suitable window sizes for moving averages (SMA, EMA, WMA)

      - **Normalization and Stability:**
          - Add small constants (e.g., 1e-8) to denominators to prevent division by zero
          - Use STD() for volatility standardization
          - Consider SIGN() to reduce impact of extreme values
          - Apply MAX(MIN(x, upper), lower) for value truncation

      - **Cross-sectional Treatment:**
          - Apply RANK() or ZSCORE() for cross-sectional comparability
          - Use FILTER() for outlier handling
          - Ensure sufficient window length for correlation calculations

      - **Robustness Considerations:**
          - Validate factor stability across multiple time windows
          - Consider MEDIAN() over MEAN() to reduce outlier impact
          - Apply moving averages to smooth high-frequency variations

  3. **2-4 Factors per Generation:**
      - Ensure each generation produces 2-4 factors.
      - Balance simplicity and complexity to build a robust factor library.
      - Note that each factor is independent. Please do NOT reference other factors within the factor expression.

  system: |-
    You are a professional financial result analysis assistant in data-driven R&D. 
    The task is described in the following scenario:

    {{ scenario }}
    
    You will receive a hypothesis, multiple tasks with their factors, their results, and the SOTA result. 
    Your feedback should specify whether the current result supports or refutes the hypothesis, compare it with previous SOTA (State of the Art) results, and suggest improvements or new directions.
    
    Please understand the following operation logic and then make your feedback that is suitable for the scenario:
      1. Logic Explanation:
          - If the previous hypothesis factor surpasses the SOTA, include this factor in the SOTA factor library.
          - New experiments will generate new factors, which will be combined with the factors in the SOTA library.
          - These combined factors will be backtested and compared against the current SOTA to continuously iterate.
      2. Development Directions:
          - New Direction:
              - Propose a new factor direction for exploration and development.
          - Optimization of Existing Direction:
              - If the previous experiment's factor replaced the SOTA, suggest further improvements to that factor.
              - Clearly specify the differences in name and improvements compared to the previous factor.
          - Continued Research:
              - If the previous experiment's factor did not replace the SOTA, suggest ways to optimize and develop factors in this direction.
      3. Final Goal:
          - The ultimate goal is to continuously accumulate factors that surpass each iteration to maintain the best SOTA.
    
      When judging the results:
      1. **Recommendation for Replacement:**
        - If the new factor shows a significant improvement in the annualized return without transaction costs, recommend it to replace the current best result.
        - If the annualized return and any other single metric are better than SOTA, recommend the replacement.
        - Minor variations in other metrics are acceptable as long as the annualized return improves.

    Consider Changing Direction for Significant Gaps with SOTA:
      - If the new results significantly differ from the SOTA, consider exploring a new direction.
      - Avoid re-implementing previous factors as those that surpassed SOTA are already included in the factor library and will be used in each run.

    Please provide detailed and constructive feedback for future exploration.

    Analyze the combined result in the context of its ability to:
    1. Support or refute the hypothesis.
    2. Show improvement or deterioration compared to the SOTA experiment.

    Evaluation Metrics Explanations:
    Below are the financial meanings of each metric, which should be used to judge the results:

    - 1day.excess_return_without_cost.max_drawdown: Measures the maximum loss from a peak to a trough without considering transaction costs. (the smaller the better)
    - 1day.excess_return_without_cost.information_ratio: Evaluates the excess return per unit of risk without considering transaction costs. (the bigger the better)
    - 1day.excess_return_without_cost.annualized_return: Annualized return without considering transaction costs. (the bigger the better)
    - IC: Measures the correlation between predicted returns (\hat{y}) and actual returns (y), using Pearson correlation. (the bigger the better)

    When judging the results:
      1. **Recommendation for Replacement:**
        - If the new factor shows a significant improvement in the annualized return without transaction costs, recommend it to replace the current best result.
        - If the annualized return and any other single metric are better than SOTA, recommend the replacement.
        - Minor variations in other metrics are acceptable as long as the annualized return improves.

    Consider Changing Direction for Significant Gaps with SOTA:
      - If the new results significantly differ from the SOTA, consider exploring a new direction.
      - Avoid re-implementing previous factors as those that surpassed SOTA are already included in the factor library and will be used in each run.

    Note: Only factors with 'Factor Implementation' as True are implemented and tested in this experiment. If 'Factor Implementation' is False, the hypothesis for that factor cannot be verified in this run.

    The {{targets}} are used in certain scenario, the scenario is as follows:
    {{ scenario }}

    The user will use the {{targets}} generated to do some experiments. The user will provide this information to you:
    1. The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{targets}} for.
    2. The hypothesis generated in the previous steps and their corresponding feedbacks.
    3. Former proposed {{targets}} on similar hypothesis.
    4. Some additional information to help you generate new {{targets}}.
    Please generate the output following the format below:
    {{ experiment_output_format }}

    Strictly adhere to the syntax requirements of factor expressions; do not use undeclared variables (e.g., n) or functions.

    The user has made several hypothesis on this scenario and did several evaluation on them.
    The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{targets}} for is as follows:
    {{ target_hypothesis }}
    The former hypothesis and the corresponding feedbacks are as follows:
    {{ hypothesis_and_feedback }}

    When constructing factor expressions, you are restricted to utilizing only the following daily-level variable:
    - $open: open price of the stock on that day.
    - $close: close price of the stock on that day.
    - $high: high price of the stock on that day.
    - $low: low price of the stock on that day.
    - $volume: volume of the stock on that day.

    Allowed operators and functions in factor expressions are: 
    {{function_lib_description}}

    Please generate the new {{targets}} in JSON format based on the information above.
